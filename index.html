            <h2>DUB</h2>
            <p>Dub Style – Dub tuning is one of the few styles that can be applied to any type of car. This type of tuning originally focused solely on large wheels, the bigger the better. There are a number of other aspects incorporated into the style such as chrome elements, tinted taillights, black window tint and more. Most vehicles with Dub tuning applications have been considerably lowered from their OEM ride height, with quite a few of them featuring hydraulics to make the vehicle hop, tip, tilt and more. Most of the cars are droped until they skim the ground and are predominantly painted black. Cadillac Escalade, Hummer H2, Chrysler 300 C are just some of the most popular cars used on this style.</p>

            <h2>LowRider</h2>
            <p>The low rider style began several decades ago, with small trucks. However, today, the style can apply to trucks, cars and vans alike. The low rider style is perhaps best known for “slamming” a vehicle to the ground. That is, lowering the vehicle’s suspension to the point that the vehicle has only a few inches of ground clearance. Hydraulics have appeared on the scene and lent it a more advanced aspect. The hydraulycs allow the rapid rise and fall of the chassis, even with the car moving. Low riders often incorporate elements of Dub style tuning, such as overly large wheels and de-badged grilles. Wheels are usually with many spokes.</p>

            <h2>German Style</h2>
            <p>This style focuses on vehicles like VW, Audi, Porsche and BMW, among others. Generally, German style tuning is more refined and elegant than other types of tuning, putting all the performance enhancements under a sleek housing that speaks of European influences. You will find large wheels (though not massive wheels), as well as numerous engine and exhaust upgrades here. Cars have cleanest lines and the most respectful of the original design of the vehicle, with droped chassis, large wheels touching the fenders.</p>

            <h2>Hot Rod</h2>
            <p>Hot rodding began in the early days of the automobile. Tuned roadsters with open engines and no fenders were one of the iconic symbols of this style. The authentic hot rod has returned today in a big way. Numerous shows around the US offer the chance to see hot rods, as well as to show off your custom creation. GreaseOrama and Viva Las Vegas are two of the most popular. Hot rod style is defined as a classic car modified for extreme performance, usually with a stylish body makeover. Model T’s, Model B’s and other classic cars are all usual examples of hot rodding.</p>

            For car fans in Germany, the Essen Motor Show remains one of the longest-standing events in the world, first opening its doors back in 1968. Consider it a bit like SEMA, but with more schnitzel.
            Friday’s preview day is when I’d normally attend Essen, and while it’s usually quieter than the public days it still felt really busy. This year though, the halls felt eerily empty in comparison.</p>
